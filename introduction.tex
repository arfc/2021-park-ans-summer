\section{Introduction}

\glspl{MSR} have attracted increasing research interest over the past two
decades. Reactor analysis software are essential tools in reactor development
because they help inform design choices in line with overarching goals such as
maximizing safety, reducing proliferation risks, and improving fuel
efficiency.

Circulating fuel \glspl{MSR} present new challenges in computational reactor
safety analysis arising from the liquid fuel form. In the primary coolant
holding the dissolved fissile material, the strong negative reactivity feedback
causes strong and near-instantaneous interactions between reactor power and
thermal-hydraulics. Thus, unexpected changes in coolant flow and temperature
have a strong impact on reactor power and vice versa.

This paper presents benchmarking results from Moltres, a coupled
neutronics/thermal-hydraulics simulation software for \glspl{MSR}. Moltres is
built on the \gls{MOOSE} \cite{gaston_physics-based_2015} finite element
framework, which provides various tools for performing fully-coupled,
NEWTON-based solves. The benchmark, referred to as the \textit{CNRS benchmark}
\cite{tiberga_results_2020}, is a numerical benchmark for software dedicated to
modeling \glspl{MSR}.
