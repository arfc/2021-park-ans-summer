\section{Introduction}

\glspl{MSR} have attracted increasing research interest over the past two
decades. Reactor
analysis software are important tools in reactor development because
they help inform design choices in line with overarching goals such as
maximizing safety, reducing proliferation risks, and improving fuel
efficiency.

Circulating fuel \glspl{MSR} present new challenges in computational reactor
safety analysis arising from the liquid fuel form. \glspl{MSR} feature strong
negative reactivity feedback in the primary coolant which holds the dissolved
fissile material. The feedback causes strong and near-instantaneous
interactions between reactor power and thermal-hydraulics. Thus,
unexpected changes in coolant flow and temperature greatly affect reactor
power and vice versa.

This paper presents benchmarking results from Moltres, a coupled
neutronics/thermal-hydraulics simulation software for \glspl{MSR}. Moltres is
built on the \gls{MOOSE} \cite{gaston_physics-based_2015} finite element
framework which provides various tools for performing fully-coupled,
NEWTON-based solves. The benchmark, referred to as the ``CNRS benchmark''
\cite{tiberga_results_2020}, is a numerical benchmark for software dedicated to
modeling \glspl{MSR}.
